Curly PHP Curl client
=====================

Main features:

- BASIC, NTLM, DIGEST and SPNEGO auth authentication support
- proxy support
- allowed http methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- request customization (User Agent, HTTP Version, Content Type, ...)

## Why?

Because I needed a CURL library that handled NTLM authentication and
let me choose what parameters should be passed to the CURL instance.

## Usage
